Project AssessmentGENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please carefully read the below instructionsThe objective of this assessment is to check your ability to complete a project as per the provided “Project Design”.You are expected to –1.Write the source code for the classes, methods and packages EXACTLYas mentioned in the “Project Design” section.2.Ensure that the names of the packages, classes, methods and variables EXACTLY MATCHwith the names specified in the “Project Design” section.3.Understand the project requirements and ACCORDINGLY WRITE the code and logic in the classes and methods so as to meet all given requirements.Creating the project and testing it –1.You  are  expected  to  create  your  project  locally  using  eclipse  (or  any  other  IDE)  on  your desktop.2.Once  you  are  ready  with  the  code,  you  should  upload  the  src  folder  of  your  project  in  .zip format, using the “Upload Zip File” button.IMPORTANT NOTE 1 : The extension of the zip file should be ONLY .zip (any other zip formats such as .7zwill produce unexpected results)IMPORTANT NOTE 2 : The .zip file should contain zip of ONLY the src folder structure from your  project.  (If  the  zip  file  has  anything  other  than  the  src  folder  structure,  the  result  will  be unexpected. Do not zip the entire project folder structure. Just do the zip of the src folder structure and upload it)IMPORTANT NOTE 3 : The name of the .zip file  should be <your employee number>.zip For e.g., if your emp no. is 12345, the zip file should be named 12345.zip.3.After uploading the zip file, you can click on “Compile & Test” button and the assessment engine will compile your source code and test it using its pre-defined test-cases.4.If  some  of  the  test-cases  fail,  you  can  make  the  fixes  in  your  source  code  locally  on  your desktop, and again repeat the above two steps.5.Once you are finished with all the fixes, you can click on “Final Submission” button, which will show you the final result/score.NOTE that –6.The assessment engine will create objects and invoke methods as per the project design, and while  doing  so,  it  will  use  your  packages,  classes  and  methods.  If  your  packages,  classes  and methods  have  a  name  mismatch  or  method  prototype  mismatch  w.r.t  the  expected  “Project Design”, the tool will show it as an ERROR. If your packages, classes and methods match as per the names but do not perform the expected functionality, the tool will show it as a FAILURE.7.Unless specified in the Project Design, DO NOT use System.exit(0)anywhere in your code. Using System.exit(0)in your project code will cause the CPC test engine to exit and it will not be able to run all test-cases.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Electricity Bill CalculationProject Objective:Create a console based Java application that would allow an electricity board clerk to compute the electricity bill amount that needs to be paid by the customer for a given type of electricity connectionDetails:There are two types of electric connections available. One is Domestic Connection and the other one is Commercial Connection. The following are the formulas that are to be used for computation of Bill for each type.DomesticUnit SlabsTariff RateFirst 50 units2.3Next 50 units4.2Remaining units5.5Eg) If units consumed is 120, then amount payable is 435.CommercialUnit SlabsTariff RateFirst 50 units5.2Next 50 units6.8Remaining units8.3In Commercial Connection type, in addition to the bill amount there is an electricity duty that is applicable. The calculations for the electricity duty is as follows:
BillAmountElectricity DutyBill Amount >= 100000.09Bill Amount >=50000.06Bill Amount < 50000.02For example, if Bill Amount>10000 thenElectricity Duty=Bill Amount* 0.09So the Final Amount Payable =Bill Amount + Electricity DutyEg) If units consumed is 120, then amount payable is 781.32 (i.e. 766 + 15.32)Project Design:A.
